    <p>Fried rice is a super simple and versatile dish that is perfect for busy people. This easy vegan fried rice is no exception.

        If you are looking for dinner inspiration that is perfect for meal prepping or just those busy nights where you want to throw something together really fast, then look no further. Vegan fried rice is definitely one of those meals that is perfect no matter what.
        
        It’s also my go to meal to use up veggies and other fridge ingredients before they go bad.</p>

        <p>Quick Tip: Fried rice is better with at least one day old rice. I usually start my weeks on Sundays by prepping a batch of rice because I know at least one meal a week I’m going to need something fast. That way my rice is already in the fridge and at least a day old!</p>
