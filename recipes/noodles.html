Saucy noodles! Who doesn’t love them? These vegan Mongolian beef noodles will have you absolutely in love all over again with a new quick and easy vegan dinner idea.

It’s also budget-friendly as most noodle dishes are.</p>

<p>We made this with longer, thicker noodles, but you can use thin, long noodles

While we prefer to use a ramen style noodle for this recipe, you can make it with any pasta. Longer noodles really do well with the sauce and it creates a more classic Asian take-out style meal, but you are welcome to switch it up!

This is a great way to do take-out at home or to elevate those cheap packages of ramen (instant-noodles) that you have sitting around in your pantry!</p>
